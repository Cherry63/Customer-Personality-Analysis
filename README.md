Customer relationship
Project Title Customer Personality Analysis
Technologies Machine Learning
Domain Customer relationship
Problem Statement:
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers.
It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to
modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different
types of customers. Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its
product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For
example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the
company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely
to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
The main objective here is -
1. What people say about your product: what gives customers’ attitude towards the
product.
2. What people do: which reveals what people are doing rather than what they are
saying about your product.
Dataset:
You have to collect your dataset for this project from different sources or use this
dataset
and based on that, you have to design your solution and create a repo for the dataset.

Project Evaluation metrics:
Code:
• You are supposed to write a code in a modular fashion (in functional blocks)
• Maintainable: It can be maintained, even as your codebase grows.
• Portable: It works the same in every environment (operating system)
• You have to maintain your code on GitHub.
• You have to keep your GitHub repo public so that anyone can check your code.
• Proper readme file you have to maintain for any project development.
• You should include basic workflow and execution of the entire project in the readme
file on GitHub

• Follow the coding standards: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
Note: After completion of all the task you need to create a PowerPoint presentation
That should contain the :
1. Problem Statement
2. Tools Used
3. Approaches
4. EDA Insights
5. Best ML Model
6. Evaluation Metrics of Model
7. Future Development
